Few months ago, my team and I were working on this cool proof of concept project to build an extensive framework built in Java using GraphQLCRUD specification.
The idea was to build a framework that provides a specification for common operation on top of GraphQL. And GraphQLCRUD Java was born.
We were able to able achieve this using the `graphql-java` library along with many interesting features.
I am going to share an overview and the capabilities of the framework in this post.

## What is GraphQLCRUD Java?

GraphQLCRUD Java is a specification that provides a set of common operations on top of GraphQL.
This Java-based framework is designed to create GraphQLCRUD-based APIs for a specified database.
Users can seamlessly integrate their existing database and data into the framework and it offers the flexibility to either construct
a straightforward application using the provided template or integrate it directly into a Java application.
The framework facilitates the exposure of a GraphQL API, providing a versatile solution for interacting with relational databases.

## Features

Let's quickly go through the features of the framework:

- When utilizing this framework, meticulously examine specifications to identify patterns aligned with your database or business requisites.
- The framework offers canonical versions and diverse variants, offering a comprehensive overview of prevalent schema approaches.
- Concentrate on your business logic and data, leveraging the framework to effortlessly generate GraphQL CRUD compliant schemas in a language of your preference.
- This tool abstracts from extensive GraphQL vendors, ensuring flexibility and the capacity to migrate seamlessly without necessitating client and resolver reconstruction.
- Prioritizing productivity, it equips developers with potent query capabilities, devoid of dependence on specific GraphQL solution providers.

## CRUD Operations and Capabilities

The framework supports the following CRUD operations:

- Create: create a new record in the database
- Update: update an existing record in the database
- Delete: delete an existing record from the database by its ID
- Get: retrieve a record from the database by its ID
- Find: retrieve a list of records from the database

There are also additional capabilities such as:

- Pagination: the ability to paginate through a list of records
- Filtering: the ability to filter records based on specific criteria/fields
- Countablity: the ability to count the number of records
- Consistency: the ability to ensure that the schema is consistent with the database

## How to does it work?

Take any database or data source, the GraphQL CRUD Java engine can automatically generate a GraphQL schema and process GraphQL queries and mutations.
So what happens is that the engine automatically generates a GraphQL schema based on the database schema and the GraphQLCRUD specification.
It defines the types and fields in the schema based on the tables and columns in the database.
In a more nested query, there is ablity to provide query with filters, pagination, and sorting as arguments to the query.
The framework offers robust functionality by providing insert mutations equipped with `input` arguments to support insert operations.
It facilitates update mutations through `filter` and `input` arguments, enabling seamless execution of bulk updates.
Furthermore, the delete mutations are incorporated with a `filter` argument to efficiently handle bulk deletion operations.

## Examples

Let's take a couple of examples to understand how the framework works.

#### Example 1: Query to get a list of all accounts

```
{
  accounts {
    account_id
    status
    ssn
    }
}
```

The above query will return a list of all accounts with their `account_id`, `status`, and `ssn`.

```
{
  "data": {
    "accounts": [
      {
        "account_id": "19980001",
        "status": "Personal",
        "ssn": "CST01002"
      },
      {
        "account_id": "19980002",
        "status": "Personal",
        "ssn": "CST01002"
      },
      {
        "account_id": "19980003",
        "status": "Personal",
        "ssn": "CST01003"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Example 2: Query to get an account using it's primary key

```
{
  account(account_id: 19980001) {
    account_id
    ssn
    status
    type
  }
}
```

The above query will return an account with `account_id` of `19980001` with its `account_id`, `status`, `ssn`, and `type`.

```
{
  "data": {
    "account": {
      "account_id": "19980001",
      "ssn": "CST01002",
      "status": "Personal",
      "type": "Active"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example 3: Query to filter customers by their first name

```
{
  customers(filter: {
    firstname: {
      eq: "James"
    }
  }) {
    firstname
    lastname
    ssn
    phone
  }
}
```

The above query will return a list of customers with `firstname` as `James` with their `firstname`, `lastname`, `ssn`, and `phone`.

```
{
  "data": {
    "customers": [
      {
        "firstname": "James",
        "lastname": "Drew",
        "ssn": "CST01036",
        "phone": "(216)555-6523"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Example 4: Query to fetch two customers starting from the top of the list using limit and pagination clause

```
{
  customers(page: {
    limit: 2
  }) {
    firstname
    lastname
    ssn
    phone
  }
}
```

The above query will return a list of customers with `limit` of `2` with their `firstname`, `lastname`, `ssn`, and `phone`.

```
{
  "data": {
    "customers": [
      {
        "firstname": "John",
        "lastname": "Doe",
        "ssn": "CST01002  ",
        "phone": "(646)555-1776"
      },
      {
        "firstname": "Bob",
        "lastname": "Smith",
        "ssn": "CST01003  ",
        "phone": "(412)555-4327"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Example 5: Query to fetch two customers starting from the 2nd record using pagination and limit clause whose firstname starts with 'J'

```
{
  customers(filter: {
    firstname: {
      startsWith: "J"
    }
  }, page: {
    limit: 2,
    offset: 2
  }) {
    firstname
    lastname
    ssn
    phone
  }
}
```

The above query will return a list of customers with `limit` of `2` and `offset` of `2` with their `firstname`, `lastname`, `ssn`, and `phone` whose `firstname` starts with `J`.

```
{
  "data": {
    "customers": [
      {
        "firstname": "Jack",
        "lastname": "Corby",
        "ssn": "CST01015  ",
        "phone": "(469)555-8023"
      },
      {
        "firstname": "James",
        "lastname": "Drew",
        "ssn": "CST01036  ",
        "phone": "(216)555-6523"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Example 6: Mutation to insert a new customer

```
mutation {
  createCustomer(input: {
    firstname: "James",
    lastname: "Corners",
    ssn: "CST00989"
  }) {
    firstname
    lastname
    ssn
  }
}
```

The above mutation will insert a new customer with `firstname` as `James`, `lastname` as `Corners`, and `ssn` as `CST00989`.

```
{
  "data": {
    "createCustomer": {
      "firstname": "James",
      "lastname": "Corners",
      "ssn": "CST00989"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example 7: Mutation to delete a customer named `Andrew`

```
mutation {
  deleteCustomer(filter: {
    firstname: {
      eq: "Andrew"
    }
  }) {
    firstname
    lastname
    ssn
    phone
  }
}
```

The above mutation will delete a customer with `firstname` as `Andrew`.

```
{
  "data": {
    "deleteCustomer": {
      "firstname": "Andrew",
      "lastname": "Moore",
      "ssn": "CST01003"
    }
  }
}
```
